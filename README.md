# HadGAN
The HadGAN has 1 generator and two discriminators, the generator $G$ produces fake samples. Discriminator $D_1$ is trained to identify whether samples are real or fake, while another discriminator $D_2$ is trained to distinguish whether the generated samples are from positive or negative distribution.
